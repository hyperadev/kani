## What is Kani?

[Kani (カニ)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/カニ) ([Pronunciation](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=kan%CA%B2i)) means Crab in
Japanese.
I'm not entirely sure why I decided to use this name, but here we are.
Kani is designed to be a [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) ForwardAuth server for
validating [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/) requests.

When a request is proxied through Cloudflare Access, a signed JWT token will be sent to the backend (Traefik in this
case) as an HTTP header.
Since the JWT token is signed, we can get the public keys from Cloudflare Access to validate that it was indeed issued
by Cloudflare Access.

## Why use Kani?

We recommend using Kani when using Cloudflare Access to protect websites.
Kani allows Traefik to validate that requests actually went through Cloudflare Access, preventing users from accessing
the page without going through Cloudflare Access.

## Getting started
